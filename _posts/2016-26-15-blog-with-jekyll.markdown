# Blogging 
While we doing something new w'll forgot manythings say for example I'm riding viluppuram to chennai in bike for first I have to many people while riding.Now I reached chennai and now I know route for viluppuram to chennai but after 2 years I planning to go again vpm to chennai but again I cannot remember the routes now I'm confused and myslef feeling bad. 

I'm thinking what is the solution for this problem so I'm planned to take notes while riding vilpurram to chennai.Now I've noted routes viluppuram->thindivanam->maruvathur->chennai now I can use this notes again and I can also give this notes to my frinds who are all travelling from villupuram to chennai.from this what I'm saying is bloggin is similar to that notes while we learning new things we can note/write something about the new one so that we can use it ang we can share it.

# Platform
Many platform is there for blogging wordpress,ghost and jekyll etc. I'm very much interested in jekyll because I like [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

# Bloggin in jekyll
Blogging in jekyll is very much easier and most of developers would like blog in jekyll

### Install RVM
Make you have installed rvm(Ruby Version Manager) in your system if not refer this link [Click Here](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)

Run ````jekyll new my-blog```` to create new jekyll project

### Running Server
Run ````cd my-blog```` and run ````jekyll serve```` to run the server.After doing you will see server log like server address: IPADDRESS:4000//

### MyBlog
Now you can find your blog in [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with basic configuration. If you want to learn how to create new post and how install new theme for your project please visit [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

# What Else Next ???
Now you can view your blog in [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) but how others can view your blog???

#### Possible way
1. you can bring domain and host your project
2. you can also host your jekyll project in github(Free)

# Github
Online project hosting using git. Refer [https://github.com](https://github.com)
1. Create account
2. Create new repo name as username.github.io (username => github username of your account)

Example myusername for github is devux.so I've created repo named as          devux.github.io 

# Host your jekyll project in github
Using git you can push your jekyll project to in github repo that you have creeated  names as ````your-user-name.github.io```` after pushing to github you can find blog in live here ````https://your-user-name.github.io```` example: [https://devux.github.io](https://devux.github.io) and for more details about jekyll refer this [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
