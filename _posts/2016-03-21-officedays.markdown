# Final year Final week
I'm counting the final days of my college days.what else next???. We all know that after this I should go for job. I don't know where I'm going to work.I'm still searching...
After some days I have applied in many places and got response from spritle.

# Call from office
I got a call from spritle.I can remeber that her name is shanthi.she is speaking with me regarding job.she asked two qeustions
1.If we are ready to offer when will you join?
2.What is your salary expectaion?
After doing some task I got selected(the questions are very tough :))

# My first day
Before a week my friend joined in the same company.now he is directing me the way to company.I'm entering to office.I just roaming around office and listening everything like new born baby.

# My Boss
From the first day onwerse I was listening my boss activity like how he is handling multiple project with smiling face.we know that is very difficult to do but he will do it easily.After some time I can realise that he can handle any kind of critical situation and he know how to handle clients in a good way. In every work he is just inspiring me.I learned many things from him and my boss name is also Balaji.

# My friends in Spritle
I don't see any misunderstanding between people.All can help others nobody will get angry.so I learned many things with the help of them.

Thirumal is main guru for me in spritle. he taught me many things both in technical and in life.

Saravanen and Ranjith are always make jokes. Im very eager and happy to spend time with saravanen.

And I learned many things day by day from prabu,steve,suren,abilash and sairam etc.

# The Fun Part

I have enjoyed a lot in spritle hackathon,outings,movie of the months and tour etc.Definitely I won't forgot every moments of that Im feeling very happy while thinking the moments.

# Time to leave
Now the time to leave from spritle.Bye bye to all my frineds!!!....

Still I can remember first day of entering in to spritle.while I coming to interview I don't know which floor is office at the time saravanen was coming and he say this is the way to office and the toughest interview HR's are Thirumal and Visnupriya.

### Bye bye to all my frineds!!!....
